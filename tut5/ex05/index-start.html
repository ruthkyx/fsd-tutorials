                   With the game locked at 10 – 10 with thirty minutes on the clock, a Munster scrum just outside the Biarritz line enabled Peter Stringer to do the unexpected and break on the blindside for an unforgettable try. A moment of sheer brilliance by the Munster and Ireland scrumhalf. The try proved to be crucial as Munster won by 23 – 19 to lift the European Cup in Cardiff.
